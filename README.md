To create a fragment application in Android Studio using Java, create a new fragment class extending Fragment and override onCreateView() to inflate its layout. Add a container for the fragment in your activity_main.xml. In your MainActivity, use FragmentManager to add the fragment to the container. Initialize and replace the fragment in the activity's onCreate() method. Ensure you handle fragment transactions properly using beginTransaction() and commit().
